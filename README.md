# Polymer-Analysis-Codes

Some analysis codes written in C. 

These are just some potentially useful codes written in C for analyzing trajectories of polymer simulations.
Routines to calculate static and dynamic correlation functions, mean squared dispacement, and to check for chain breaks.

Disclaimer: These are some old, hastily written codes that I intend to clean up and make more user friendly with better documentation.

Codes read input coordinates from molecular dynamics in binary form.
bina_file.c will convert text format of a trajectory into binary for use with the other codes.

TO DO: re-write and clean up in C++
